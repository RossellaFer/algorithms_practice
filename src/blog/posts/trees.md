Trees are a nonlinear data structure that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
A tree usually starts with a single root node and every child of the tree descends from this parent node. Every child descends only from one parent. Within a tree you can have a subtree, for example in this image [3, 6 and 7] form a subtree of the main tree.

- Facebook comments, where I can comment on a friends photo and they can comment on my comment
- Chess game (before machine learning) picked moves based on a tree data structure
- Family tree
- Abstract syntax tree, used to represent the structure of a program's source code for the compiler to use
